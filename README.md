# biodiversity_project

This is one of two Codecademy data analysis capstone projects that I completed. The premise is that the National Parks Service would like to know if there are any patterns to species that fall under a protected category (defined to be either endangered, threatened, or a species of concern), and how many observations they will need to make to determine if a Foot and Mouth Disease reduction program in Yellowstone National Park is working. Data on wildlife species found in America's National Parks was analyzed to determine that mammal species were most likely to fall under a protected category; also, when combined with data on observations of wildlife in National Parks, the number of weeks it would take to make the requisite number of mammilian sheep species observations was calculated. I summarized my findings in a report.

I used Python 3.8 to complete this project, in addtion to Jupyter Notebook. Packages utilized include Pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib. As Codecademy explained in the project, the data they provided is mostly fictional but inspired by real data; hence, I cannot include the actual data in this repository. However, I am including a print-out of my Jupyter Notebook, so that you can see how my code ran and what it output. The schema of the provided data tables can be found in the Jupyter Notebook print-out.

I decided to write up my results as a report of sorts, rather than the Microsoft PowerPoint presentation that Codecademy recommended; I have included the report as "biodiversity_Codecademy_capstone_project.pdf."

My Jupyter Notebook print-out is included as "biodiversity_MAC_sols.pdf". This could be a little hard to read, and I just realized that an uploaded Jupyter Notebook saves the outputs of the last time the cell was run, so that you can see the output of the cells without me having to upload the data files; so, I have uploaded the actual Jupyter Notebook file as well as "biodiversity_MAC_sols.ipynb."
